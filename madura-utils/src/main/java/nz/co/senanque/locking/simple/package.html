<p>Simple lock delivers a lock that is safe across threads in the same JVM. It is NOT safe across multiple JVMs. If you need
to kill a rogue lock then you can just delete the relevant database row.</p>
<p>It includes a JMX interface to allow you to manually manage locks (ie view and kill) if necessary.</p>
